      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p>As a Philosophy student in college, I found that, more often than not, profundity exists within the simplest concepts. Outside of the fancy academic jargon and verbose articles, the truth was almost always the simplest explanation. 

      <br><br>We as humans constantly find ourselves grappling with complex problems in an ever-changing world, but through the power of technology we are able to simplify these problems for the average consumer, thereby making what was once inaccessible accessible while also shifting our paradigms and how we see the world in real-time. 
          
      <br><br>And it is this concept, this universality of access that interests me the most. I am passionate about technology because I have a strong desire to identify simple solutions to complex, real-world problems.
